      <p>Ohmydown is a web service that offers you the opportunity to keep track of any website that you own —or not—, in terms of
        observability, that is, uptime, delays and more to come.
      </p>

      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>We want to offer easy access to everybody to this kind of information, with a very extensive free plan.
      </p>

      <div className={aboutStyles.about__example}>
      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>Here's a little example of what we offer, a delay chart of several urls that you can follow in your profile.
